          The tech stack is based on top of React for the front-end, tailwind
          used for the UI,Redux for Global state management, used & RustApi
          backend and deployed on Render.

          I've introduced a quiz option for those who desire to get quizzed.
          Multiple choice and name it questions are the two types of questions.
          In the multiple choice, I've included an algorithm that generates six
          different types of questions based on the user's preferred continent.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'd love for you to test out the quiz app and let me know what you
          think.

          I work primarily on the frontend, the only thing the backend is for is
          for demonstrating authorization and authentication. with that being
          said the app is front end heavy equips with React ContextApi and
          Reducers to handle the global state
